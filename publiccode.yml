    shortDescription: >
      Open source multi-modal trip planner focusing on travel by scheduled and flexible public
      transportation in combination with walking, bicycling, car and mobility services.
    longDescription: >
      OpenTripPlanner (OTP) is an open source multi-modal trip planner, focusing on travel by scheduled
      public transportation in combination with bicycling, walking, and mobility services including bike
      share and ride hailing. Its server component runs on any platform with a Java virtual machine (
      including Linux, Mac, and Windows). It exposes GraphQL APIs that can be accessed by various
      clients including open source Javascript components and native mobile applications. It builds its
      representation of the transportation network from open data in open standard file formats (primarily
      NeTEx, GTFS, GBFS and OpenStreetMap). It applies real-time updates and alerts with immediate 
      visibility to clients, finding itineraries that account for disruptions and service changes.


      The project was launched by Portland, Oregon's transport agency TriMet in July 2009 and has been
      in active development for over 15 years. This is OpenTripPlanner 2 (OTP2), the second major version
      which has been under development since 2018 and is now the dominant version being actively supported.


      Key features include:

      - Multi-modal routing (public transit, walking, biking, car)

      - Real-time updates for transit disruptions and service changes supporting Siri, GTFS-RT and 
        GBFS data formats.

      - Support for GTFS and NeTEx transit data formats

      - OpenStreetMap integration for street network data

      - GraphQL API for flexible data queries

      - Support for bike share, ride hailing, and mobility services

      - High-performance routing algorithms (RAPTOR-based)

      - Flexible itinerary filtering and optimization

      - Multi-criteria journey planning with pareto-optimal results
