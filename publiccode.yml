    shortDescription: Open source multi-modal trip planner focused on travel by
      scheduled and flexible public transportation combined with street routing.
    longDescription: OpenTripPlanner (OTP) is an open source multi-modal trip
      planner, focused on travel by scheduled public transportation in combination
      with walking, cycling, driving, and mobility services including bike
      share and ride hailing. Its server component runs on any platform with a
      Java virtual machine (including Linux, Mac, and Windows). It exposes
      GraphQL APIs that can be accessed by various clients including open source
      Javascript components and native mobile applications. It builds its
      representation of the transportation network from open data in open standard
      file formats (primarily NeTEx, Siri, GTFS, GBFS and OpenStreetMap). It
      applies real-time updates and alerts with immediate visibility to clients,
      finding itineraries that account for disruptions and service changes.
